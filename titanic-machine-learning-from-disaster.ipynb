process will follow a structured approach:\n\n1. **Feature selection:** we retain only variables that proved meaningful during the EDA, avoiding redundancy (e.g., using `FamilySize` instead of `SibSp` and `Parch`).  \n2. **Train–test split:** the cleaned dataset is split into training (70%) and validation (30%) subsets to obtain an unbiased estimate of model performance.  \n3. **Model choice:** we start with simple baseline models and progressively evaluate more expressive algorithms, monitoring improvements in accuracy.  \n4. **Performance evaluation:** predictions are compared against the validation set, and accuracy is used as the primary metric, while being mindful of dataset imbalance and the limitations of accuracy alone.\n\nThis chapter therefore moves from *understanding the data* to *leveraging it* — translating insights into a predictive model that reflects both historical constraints and statistical evidence.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-15T07:43:46.303634Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-15T07:43:46.303129Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-15T07:43:46.381278Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-15T07:43:46.380036Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.085108,"end_time":"2025-12-15T07:43:46.382916","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-12-15T07:43:46.297808","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_X
