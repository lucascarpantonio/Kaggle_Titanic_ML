instead of `SibSp` and `Parch`).  \n","2. **Train–test split:** the cleaned dataset is split into training (70%) and validation (30%) subsets to obtain an unbiased estimate of model performance.  \n","3. **Model choice:** we start with simple baseline models and progressively evaluate more expressive algorithms, monitoring improvements in accuracy.  \n","4. **Performance evaluation:** predictions are compared against the validation set, and accuracy is used as the primary metric, while being mindful of dataset imbalance and the limitations of accuracy alone.\n","\n","This chapter
