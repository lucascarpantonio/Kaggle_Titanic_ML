Introduction\n","\n","On the night of April 14th, 1912, an engineering marvel called RMS Titanic struck an iceberg during its maiden voyage and tragically sank in the North Atlantic.

The disaster revealed how social class, cabin location, age, gender and family structure profoundly influenced the likelihood of survival.\n","\n","The purpose of this analysis is to explore these factors using the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle:  \n","1. to examine which features had the strongest impact on survival,  \n","2. to build a predictive model using rigorous data preparation and feature engineering, and  \n","3. to generate survival predictions for the passengers in the test set.\n","\n","This notebook follows a structured workflow — from exploratory data analysis to model training and final prediction — aiming to reproduce, as faithfully as possible, the real-world patterns that shaped survival on the Titanic."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"7e18c57c","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-14T15:03:32.285713Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-14T15:03:32.285202Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-14T15:03:32.404311Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-14T15:03:32.403179Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.130135,"end_time":"2025-12-14T15:03:32.406371","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-12-14T15:03:32.276236","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 891 entries, 0 to 890\n","Data columns (total 12 columns):\n"," #   Column       Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------       --------------  -----  \n"," 0   PassengerId  891 non-null    int64  \n"," 1   Survived     891 non-null    int64  \n"," 2   Pclass       891 non-null    int64  \n"," 3   Name         891 non-null    object \n"," 4   Sex          891 non-null    object \n"," 5   Age          714 non-null    float64\n"," 6   SibSp        891 non-null    int64  \n"," 7   Parch        891 non-null    int64  \n"," 8   Ticket       891 non-null    object \n"," 9   Fare         891 non-null    float64\n"," 10  Cabin        204 non-null    object \n"," 11  Embarked     889 non-null    object \n","dtypes: float64(2), int64(5), object(5)\n","memory usage: 83.7+ KB\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>PassengerId</th>\n","      <th>Survived</th>\n","      <th>Pclass</th>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th>Sex</th>\n","      <th>Age</th>\n","      <th>SibSp</th>\n","      <th>Parch</th>\n","      <th>Ticket</th>\n","      <th>Fare</th>\n","      <th>Cabin</th>\n","      <th>Embarked</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Braund, Mr. Owen Harris</td>\n","      <td>male</td>\n","      <td>22.0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>A/5 21171</td>\n","      <td>7.2500</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>S</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Th...</td>\n","      <td>female</td>\n","      <td>38.0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>PC 17599</td>\n","      <td>71.2833</td>\n","      <td>C85</td>\n","      <td>C</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Heikkinen, Miss.
